            <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
            <p>Born to Maye Musk, a Canadian-born model and dietitian, and Errol Musk, a South African electromechanical engineer, Elon showed an early interest in computing and technology. At just ten years old, he developed a passion for computing and video games, teaching himself programming from the VIC-20 user manual. By age twelve, he had created and sold his first software, a BASIC-based game called Blastar, to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.</p>
            <p>Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, followed by Bryanston High School, and graduated from Pretoria Boys High School. To avoid South Africa's mandatory military service, he applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother and moved to Canada in 1989, where he enrolled at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. After two years, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, earning a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the Wharton School in 1997.</p>

                <p>In 1995, Musk co-founded Zip2 with his brother Kimbal Musk and Greg Kouri. The company provided online city guide software for newspapers, offering business directories, maps, and navigation services. By 1998, Zip2 had partnered with approximately 160 newspapers, including major publications like The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.

                <p>Following the sale of Zip2, Musk founded X.com in 1999, an online financial services and email payment company. X.com was among the first federally insured online banks, attracting over 200,000 customers in its initial months. In 2000, X.com merged with Confinity, which had developed a money-transfer service called PayPal. The merged entity focused on the PayPal service, which quickly became a leader in online payments.

                <h3>Business Practices and Leadership Style</h3>
                <p>Musk's leadership approach has been scrutinized for fostering a demanding work environment. Employees at Tesla have reported long working hours and safety concerns, with some alleging a toxic workplace culture that prioritizes productivity over employee well-being. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has received multiple complaints regarding unsafe practices at Tesla's Fremont Factory.</p>
                <p>Additionally, Musk has faced allegations of union-busting. As of 2025, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had 24 open investigations into Musk's companies, including Tesla, SpaceX, and X Corp. (formerly Twitter), concerning alleged surveillance of employees and interference with union organizing efforts.</p>

                <h3>Political Activities and Public Statements</h3>
                <p>Musk's political engagements have sparked significant controversy. In December 2024, he endorsed Germany's far-right political party, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), stating that "Only the AfD can save Germany" and criticizing other political parties for failing the populace. This endorsement drew sharp criticism from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and other European leaders.</p>
                <p>In January 2025, during a rally celebrating U.S. President Donald Trump's second inauguration, Musk made a gesture interpreted by many as a Nazi or fascist Roman salute. This act was widely condemned, particularly in Germany, where such gestures are illegal. Jewish organizations and Holocaust survivors expressed serious concerns, with some calling for Musk to clarify or apologize for the gesture. Musk dismissed the accusations, referring to them as "dirty tricks" and "tired" attacks.</p>
